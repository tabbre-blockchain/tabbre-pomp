This is an implementation of the Tabbre Proof of Majority Protocol (POMP), a decentralised consensus protocol that scales linearly, the more network and processing capacity that is added, the more transaction throughput the system can handle. 

This implementation is built using node.js, mongodb, mongoose and express.js. The interfaces between the components are all implemented as RESTful APIs.
